# SpotifyWebAPICall

# The code doesn't work unless you do the following:

# I've included comments at the beginning of my code detailing what Python libraries you need to install (make sure you install Spotipy as well) on your  command prompt/terminal (depending on what OS you use.) 

# Also, make sure you sign up for your API key and Client Secret. I chose not to include mine. Make sure you put them in the correct place within the code. The code doesn't work without them. 

# That's it!

# Enjoy the music!

# Take care.
